00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.470
Most unfortunately
there are only two talks

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.040
and so we have to condense
what we have to say

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.130
about the whole
existence of life.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.230
We are not doing any kind
of propaganda,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.260
we are not persuading you to
think in one particular direction,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.130
nor convince you about
anything.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.650
We must be quite sure
of that.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.240
We are not bringing
something exotic from the East,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.170
all that nonsense that goes on
in the name of the gurus

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.990
and those people who write
strange things after visiting India.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.230
We do not belong to
that crowd at all.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.490
But we would like to point out

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.700
that during these two talks

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.390
that we are thinking together,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.400
not merely listening
to the talks,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.590
listening to some ideas,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.380
either agreeing or disagreeing
with those ideas,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:37.120
we are not creating any kind
of arguments, opinions, judgements,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.820
but together – I mean together,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:51.990
you and the speaker, are going to
observe what the world has become,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.130
not only in the Western world
but also in the East

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.380
where there is a great deal
of poverty, great misery,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.320
an enormous amount
of population,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.140
where the politicians,
as here in the West,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.520
are incapable of dealing
with what is happening.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.490
They are all politicians
thinking in terms of tribalism.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.100
Tribalism has become
the glorified nationalism.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:53.330
And we cannot therefore rely on
any politicians, or on any leader,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:03.630
or on any books that have
been written about religion.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.470
We cannot possibly rely on
any of these people,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.940
neither the scientists, nor
the biologists, nor the psychologists.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.030
They have not been able
to solve our human problems.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.580
I am quite sure
you agree to all that.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.360
Nor can we rely on
any of the gurus.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.480
Unfortunately these people
come to the West

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.400
and exploit people,
get very rich,

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.580
and they have nothing
whatsoever to do with religion.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.370
Having said all that,
it is important that we,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.030
you and the speaker,
think together.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.070
We mean by
thinking together,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:19.560
not merely accepting
any kind of opinion or evaluation

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:29.890
but together observe
not only externally

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.990
– that is, what is happening
in the world –

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.140
but also what is happening to
all of us inwardly, psychologically.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:56.210
Externally, outwardly there is
great uncertainty, confusion, wars,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.780
or the threat of war.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.260
There are wars going on
in some parts of the world,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.670
human beings
are killing each other.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.160
That is not happening
in the West, here,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:24.840
but there is the threat
of the nuclear war,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:33.230
the bomb, and
the preparation for war.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:44.800
And we ordinary human beings
do not seem to be able

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.120
to do anything
about all that.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:59.810
There are demonstrations, terrorism,
hunger strikes and so on.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:07.780
This is what is actually going on
in the outward world;

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.730
one tribal group
against another tribal group;

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:20.970
the West, America against
another country and so on.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.240
The scientists are
contributing to all that,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.550
and the philosophers, though
they may talk against all that

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:40.410
but inwardly they continue
in terms of nationalism,

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:46.120
according to their own
particular career and so on.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:52.090
So that is what is actually
going on in the outward world,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:59.650
of which any intelligent
human being can observe.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:07.930
And inwardly, in our own minds
and in our own hearts,

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.680
we are also very confused.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:22.440
There is no security, not
only perhaps for ourselves

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:30.130
but for our future,
our future generation.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.910
Religions have divided human beings
as the Christian, the Hindus,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.170
the Muslims and
the Buddhists and so on.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:10:02.170
So considering all this,
looking objectively, calmly,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:11.140
without any prejudice,
observing,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:20.810
it is naturally important that
we think about all this together.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:32.510
Think together. Not have opinions
opposing another set of opinions;

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.890
or one conclusion
against another conclusion,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.680
one ideal
against another ideal;

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:55.440
but rather think together and see
what we human beings can do.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:11.300
The crisis is not in the economic world
nor in the political world,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:20.260
but the crisis is
in our consciousness.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:27.180
I think very few of us
realise that.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.680
The crisis is in our mind
and in our heart.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:44.820
That is, the crisis is in
our consciousness.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:58.340
Our consciousness, which is our
whole existence, with our beliefs,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:04.650
with our conclusions,
with our nationalism,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:11.730
with all the fears that one has,
the pleasures,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:20.950
the apparently insoluble
problem of sorrow,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:30.440
the thing that we call love,
compassion,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.910
and the problem of death,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:42.280
and what is there,
if there is anything hereafter,

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:48.320
and the question of
meditation,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:59.190
and if there is anything
beyond time, beyond thought,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.000
if there is something eternal.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:09.240
That is the content of
our consciousness.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:15.030
That is the content of
every human being,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:24.050
whether they live in
this country or in Asia,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.810
in India or in America
or Russia.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:38.300
The content of our consciousness
is the common ground of all humanity.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:47.520
I think this must be made very clear
right from the beginning.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:58.270
As a human being living in
this part of the world, he suffers,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:10.280
not only physically
but also inwardly.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:19.490
He is anxious, uncertain,
fearful, confused,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:31.820
anxious, without
any sense of deep security.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:40.020
It is the same in Asia,
with every human being there,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:46.970
it is the same in India, it is
the same in America and Russia.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:56.700
So our consciousness
is common to all mankind.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.430
Please do listen to this.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.990
You may be hearing this
for the first time

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.020
and so please don’t discard it.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:17.840
Let’s investigate it together,
let’s think about it together.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.920
Not when you get home
but now.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:30.990
That your consciousness –
what you think, what you feel,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.840
your reactions, your anxiety,
your loneliness, your sorrow,

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:50.060
your pain, the search for something
that is not merely physical

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.580
but goes beyond all thought –

00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:03.630
is the same as a person living
in India or Russia or America.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.420
They go through the same
problems as you do,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:16.780
the same problems of relationship
with each other, man, woman.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:24.370
So we are all standing on 
the same ground - consciousness.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:31.570
Our consciousness
is common to all of us.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.340
And therefore
we are not individuals.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.650
Please do consider this.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:53.910
We have been trained, educated,
religiously as well as scholastically,

00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:01.440
that we are separate souls,
individuals, striving for ourselves,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.490
but that is an illusion

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:10.840
because our consciousness
is common to all mankind.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.870
So we are mankind.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.230
We are not separate individuals
fighting for ourselves.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:28.900
This is logical,
this is rational, sane.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:40.400
So we are not separate entities
with separate psychological content

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.250
struggling for ourselves.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:57.380
But we are, each one of us is
actually the rest of human kind.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:07.050
So logically, perhaps
you will accept it intellectually,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.690
but if you feel that
profoundly,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:21.130
then our whole activity
undergoes a radical change.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:29.910
That is the first issue that
we have to think together about:

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:42.820
that our consciousness,
the way we think, the way we live,

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.030
perhaps more comfortably,
affluently,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.230
with greater facility to travel
and so on,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:19:00.490
apart from that,
inwardly, psychologically,

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:06.040
you are exactly similar
to those who live

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:12.930
thousands and thousands
of miles away.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.510
And so we have to think about
these problems together.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:31.890
First, the problem
of relationship:

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:44.080
All life is relationship,
the very existence is to be related.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.000
And when you observe
what we have done

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:53.580
with our relationship with each other,
whether it is intimate or not,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.870
whether between two human beings,
man and woman,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:09.700
in that relationship there is
tremendous conflict, struggle - why?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:20.820
Why have human beings, who have
lived for over a million years,

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:26.460
have not solved this problem
of relationship?

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:35.620
That is, two people living together
without conflict.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:43.670
Apparently we have not
solved it.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:52.060
So if we could this morning
perhaps for an hour,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.500
think together about it.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:05.610
Let’s together observe actually
what is that relationship

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.490
between a man and a woman,

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:20.500
because all society
is based on relationship.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.870
There is no society
if there is no relationship,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.270
society then
becomes an abstraction.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.430
So we should together,
this morning,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:49.370
consider together what
our relationships actually are.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:22:03.660
If one observes it closely there is
conflict between man and woman.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:12.240
The man has his own ideals,
his own pursuits, his own ambition,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:22.540
he is always seeking success,
to be somebody in the world.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:32.450
And also the woman is struggling,
also wanting to be somebody,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:38.420
wanting to fulfil,
to become.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:43.690
Each is pursuing
his own direction.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:50.320
So it is like two railway lines
running parallel but never meeting,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:23:01.300
perhaps in bed but otherwise,
if you observe closely

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:11.220
they never meet actually,
psychologically, inwardly – why?

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.290
That is the question.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:23.550
When we ask why, we are always
asking for the cause,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.650
we think in terms
of causation,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:35.920
hoping thereby if we could
understand the cause

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:42.200
then perhaps
we would change the effect.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:50.390
May I ask now – you all
understand English I hope.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:24:03.600
If not I am talking to myself,
which is rather absurd.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.220
One has not been
in this country for ten years

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.750
but one is glad
to be back here again,

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.740
but if we don’t
understand English

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:29.250
then I am afraid our communication
is not possible.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:42.030
So one hopes that you understand
English as clearly as possible.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.510
Unfortunately one can speak
in French or Italian

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.800
but that would be
equally difficult.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:00.190
So we are asking a very simple
but very complex question:

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:07.600
why is it that we human beings
have not been able

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:13.720
to solve this problem of relationship
though we have lived on this earth

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:21.010
for over millions and
millions of years?

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:30.540
Is it because each one
has his own particular image

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.070
put together by thought,

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:41.320
and our relationship
is only based on two images:

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.620
the image that the man
creates about her

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:52.260
and the image the woman
creates about him?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:26:02.000
So, we are in this relationship :
two images living together.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.270
That is a fact.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:12.510
If you observe very closely yourself,
if one may point out,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.090
you have created an image
about her,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:27.770
and she has created a picture,
a verbal structure about you, the man.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:35.110
So relationship is between
these two images.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:41.660
These images have been
put together by thought.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:52.030
And thought
is not related to love.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:01.050
Is thought love?

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:08.680
All the memories of this
relationship with each other,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:15.090
the remembrances, the pictures,
the conclusions about each other,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:25.570
are - if one observes closely,
without any prejudice -

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:31.340
are the product of thought,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:36.810
are the result of various
remembrances,

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:45.940
experiences, irritations,
loneliness.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:53.040
And so our relationship
with each other is not love

00:27:53.050 --> 00:28:03.130
but the image that thought
has put together.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:09.290
So we have to examine,
if we are to understand

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:15.510
the actuality of relationship,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.250
we have to understand
the whole movement of thought

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:34.630
because we live by thought,
all our actions are based on thought;

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:43.090
all the great buildings of the world
are put together by thought,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:52.000
all the cathedrals, churches,
temples and mosques

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:57.590
are put there by thought,
constructed by thought.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.990
And what is inside all these
religious buildings –

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.250
the inside, the figures,
the symbols, the images –

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.920
are all
the inventions of thought.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:20.000
There is no refuting that.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.920
So thought has created not only

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:30.560
the most marvellous
architectural buildings

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.030
and the contents
of those buildings,

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:41.720
but also it has created
the instruments of war,

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:50.360
the bomb,
various forms of that bomb.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:56.980
Thought has also put together
the surgeon,

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:04.720
those marvellous instruments,
so delicate in surgery.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.290
And also thought
has made the carpenter.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.500
He must study the wood,
the instruments and so on.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:19.140
So thought has done all this.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:32.740
The content of a church and the surgeon,

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:38.770
the expert engineer
who builds a beautiful bridge,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:45.040
are all the result of thought.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:53.470
There is no refuting that
however much one may argue.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:59.550
So one has to examine
what is thought,

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:06.200
why human beings
live on thought,

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:11.310
why thought has brought about
such chaos in the world –

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:18.140
war, lack of relationship
with each other,

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:27.860
the great capacity of thought
with its extraordinary energy.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.300
And also what thought has done
through millions of years,

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.850
bringing sorrow for mankind.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.530
Please observe this together,
let’s examine it together.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:55.260
Don’t let’s oppose what the speaker
is saying but let’s examine it,

00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:02.900
what he is saying together
so that we understand

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:08.480
what is actually happening
to all human beings.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.210
We are destroying ourselves.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:20.190
So we have to go very carefully
into the question of thought.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:27.400
Thought is the response
of memory.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:37.240
Memory is not only
the remembrance of things past

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:45.250
but also thought which projects
itself as hope in the future.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:55.670
So thought is the response
of memory, memory is knowledge,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.910
knowledge is experience.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:07.160
That is, there is experience,
from experience there is knowledge,

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:12.310
from knowledge there is memory,
or remembrance,

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.030
and from memory you act.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:24.170
So from that action you learn,
which is further knowledge.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.900
So we live in this cycle –

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:33.330
experience, knowledge, memory,
thought, action.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.940
In this cycle
human beings live,

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:41.040
always living
within the field of knowledge.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:45.040
I hope this is not boring you.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:49.680
If you are bored,
I am sorry.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:55.130
If you want something
romantic, sentimental,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:03.900
something that pleases you,
I hope you won’t listen then.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:08.630
But what we are talking about
is very serious.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:15.540
It is not something for the weekend,
for a casual listening

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:24.660
because we are concerned with the
radical change of human consciousness.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:32.540
So we have to think about all this,
look together, see if it is possible

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:36.610
why human beings
who have lived on this earth

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.460
for so many million years
are still as we are.

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:45.410
We may have advanced
technologically,

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.520
better communication,
better transportation,

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:56.810
hygiene and so on, but inwardly
we are the same, more or less:

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:11.770
unhappy, uncertain, lonely, carrying
the burden of sorrow endlessly.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:18.800
And any serious man confronted
with this challenge must respond,

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:23.090
he can’t take it casually,
turn his back on it.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:31.510
That is why this meeting and tomorrow
morning’s meeting is very serious

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.990
because we have to apply
our minds and our hearts

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.680
to find out if it is possible to
radically bring about a mutation

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:51.950
in our consciousness and therefore
in our action and behaviour.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:36:06.620
So as we were saying, thought
is born of experience, knowledge

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:14.460
and so there is nothing whatsoever
sacred about thought.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:24.540
It is materialistic, it is
a process of matter, thinking.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:32.180
And we have relied on that,
on thought to solve all our problems,

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:39.530
political, religious,
relationship and so on.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:46.570
And our brains, our minds
are conditioned,

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.580
educated to solve problems.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:59.030
Thought has created the problem
and then our brains, our minds,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.520
are trained to solve problems.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:08.130
If you have an engineering
problem you solve it,

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.340
a problem of disease,
one solves it and so on.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:18.900
Our minds are trained
to solve problems.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:25.680
These problems are created by thought
psychologically, inwardly.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.240
You follow what is happening?

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:33.230
Thought creates the problem
psychologically

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.520
and the mind is trained
to solve problems,

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:42.780
so thought,
creating the problem,

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:46.100
thought then
tries to solve the problem.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.940
So it is caught in the same
old process, a routine.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.880
So problems are becoming
more and more complex,

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.720
more and more insoluble.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:04.820
So we must find,
if it is at all possible,

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:11.610
if there is a different way
of approaching this life,

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:20.170
not through thought because
thought has not solved our problems.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:29.400
On the contrary, thought has
brought about greater complexity.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:35.740
We must find if it is possible,
or if it is not possible,

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:40.000
if there is a different
dimension,

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:44.470
a different approach to life
altogether.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.400
And that is why it is important
to understand the nature of thought,

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:55.710
the nature of our thinking.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:07.230
Our thinking is based on remembrance,
remembrance of things past.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:14.080
Which is, thinking about
what happened a week ago,

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.060
thinking about it,
modified in the present

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.320
and projected into the future.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:27.260
This is the movement of our life,
which is an actuality.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:35.810
So knowledge has become
all important for us

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:42.050
but knowledge
is never complete.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.540
Knowledge about anything
is still incomplete,

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.010
will always be incomplete.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:56.620
Therefore knowledge
always goes with ignorance,

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.190
knowledge always lives
within the shadow of ignorance.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.500
That is a fact.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:11.390
It is not the speaker’s invention,
or conclusion, but that is so.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:19.860
So, love is not knowledge.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:25.190
Love is not remembrance.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.020
Love is not desire
or pleasure.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:38.040
Desire, pleasure, remembrance
are based on thought.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:45.200
So our relationship
with each other,

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:52.570
however close, however near,
if you look at it closely,

00:40:52.580 --> 00:41:00.800
is based on remembrance
which is thought.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:07.160
So in that relationship actually,
though one may say you love

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:11.070
your wife or your husband
or your girlfriend and so on,

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:18.090
it is actually based on remembrance
which is thought.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:24.800
Therefore in that
there is no love.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:37.390
Would you actually see that fact?
Or do we say,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:43.680
‘What terrible things you are saying.
I do love my wife’ –

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:48.680
but is that so?

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.580
Can there be love
when there is jealousy,

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.440
possessiveness, attachment,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:01.140
when each one is pursuing
his own particular ambition,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:05.480
greed, envy, direction,

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:09.750
like two parallel lines
never meeting.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.310
Is that love?

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:19.200
So one has to enquire
if one is to pursue

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:24.170
the problem of existence
seriously, profoundly,

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.220
one must examine
what is desire.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:38.280
Why human beings
have been driven by desire.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:45.940
Can the speaker
go on with all this?

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:59.950
Sorry, you have to bear this but
it is your fault that you are here!

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:07.020
And perhaps also
the speaker’s!

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:16.920
I hope we are thinking together,
observing together,

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:23.360
as two friends
walking along that road

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:28.540
and seeing
what is around us,

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:35.850
not only what is very close,
what is immediately perceived,

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:42.580
but also what one sees
in the distance,

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:47.990
because we are taking
the journey together,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.610
perhaps affectionately,
hand in hand,

00:43:52.620 --> 00:44:07.640
or as two friends, amicable, examining
the very complex problem of life

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:14.870
in which there is no leader,
there is no guru,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:22.260
because when one actually sees
that our consciousness

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:27.250
is the consciousness of
the rest of mankind

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.670
then we realise we are both
the guru and the disciple,

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.330
the teacher as well
as the pupil,

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:44.790
because we are all that,
it is all in our consciousness.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.700
That is a tremendous
realisation.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:56.540
So that as one begins to
understand oneself deeply

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:03.280
one becomes a light to oneself
and not depend on anybody,

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:13.440
on any book, on any authority,
including that of the speaker,

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:18.870
so that we are capable
of understanding

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:29.210
this whole problem of living
and be a light to ourselves.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:37.150
So we must examine
together desire,

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:47.720
because if desire is love
then desire creates problems.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:57.380
Love has no problems, and to
understand the nature of love,

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.780
compassion,
with its own intelligence,

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:09.080
we must understand
together what is desire.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:14.690
Desire has
extraordinary vitality,

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:26.680
extraordinary persuasion,
drive, achievement,

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:35.440
and the whole process of becoming,
success, is based on desire –

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:45.750
desire which makes us compare
with each other, imitate, conform.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.780
So it is very important

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:52.800
in understanding the whole
nature of ourselves

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.980
to understand what desire is,

00:46:54.990 --> 00:47:04.250
not to suppress it,
not to run away from it,

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.330
not to transcend it,
but to understand it,

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:14.400
to look at it, to see
the whole momentum of it.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.720
We can do that together,

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:25.990
which doesn’t mean that you are
learning from the speaker.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.690
The speaker has nothing to teach you.
Please realise this.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:37.560
The speaker is merely acting as a
mirror in which you can see yourself.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.640
And then
when you see yourself clearly

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.170
you can discard the mirror,
it has no importance,

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:48.850
you can break it up.

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:56.150
So to understand desire
requires attention, seriousness,

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.260
it is a very complex problem.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:09.880
Why human beings have lived on
this extraordinary energy of desire

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.280
as the energy of thought.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:21.710
What is the relationship
between thought and desire?

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:27.970
What is the relationship
between desire and will?

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:34.370
Because we live a great deal
by will.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:46.150
So, what is the movement,
the source, the origin of desire?

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:58.330
If one observes oneself
one sees the origin,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:12.620
the beginning of desire begins
with sensation, sensory responses,

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:21.460
sensory responses
with its contact, sensation,

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:33.040
then thought creates the image,
at that moment begins desire.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.960
Please let’s look at it
very closely.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.680
One sees something
in the window,

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:47.070
a robe, a shirt, a car,
a scarf, whatever it is -

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:56.250
seeing, sensation,
then touching it,

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.760
and then thought saying,

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:04.480
‘If I put that dress or shirt on
how nice it will look’ –

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:09.270
it creates the image,
then begins desire.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.750
Right?
Do you follow all this?

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:19.480
See it for oneself,
it is fairly simple.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:24.460
You see something very nice,

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:32.210
there is the sensation
created through nervous responses,

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:38.000
optical response,
then thought saying,

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:43.330
'how nice I would look with
that dress, or shirt, or coat'

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:50.230
or whatever it is,
then desire begins.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:51:01.120
So, the relationship between desire
and thought is very close.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:05.320
If there was no thought
there would be only sensation -

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:10.560
not all the problems
created by desire.

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:15.120
I hope we are meeting
each other.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:24.350
So desire is the
quintessence of will.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:35.740
So, thought dominates sensation
and creates the urge,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:41.580
the desire to possess.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:47.830
Am I talking to myself,
or are you all in it?

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:57.420
Perhaps all this
may be new to you,

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:01.090
but we have to think about
all these things together,

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:06.060
not as separate individual
with his own particular conclusions

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:16.820
but together observe all this
and be very clear about all this.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:27.130
So where in relationship
thought operates,

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:32.570
which is remembrance creating
the image about each other,

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:41.630
where there is that image created
by thought there can be no love.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:53.710
Or where there is desire,
sexual or other forms of desire,

00:52:53.720 --> 00:53:03.310
prevents – because desire
is part of thought – prevents love.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:14.040
And also we should consider
in our examination together

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:19.560
the nature of fear,

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:30.060
because we are all caught in
this terrible thing called fear.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.820
We don’t seem
to be able to resolve it.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:45.390
We live with it, become accustomed
to it, or escape from it,

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.850
through amusement,
through worship,

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:58.120
through various forms of entertainment,
religious and otherwise.

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:12.650
So we must together examine again
the nature and the structure of fear.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:19.600
Please,
fear is common to all of us,

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:26.290
whether you live in this tidy,
clean country,

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:33.760
or in India where it is untidy,
dirty, over-populated, and so on.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:39.280
It is the same problem,
fear.

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:45.420
And man has lived with it for
thousands and thousands of years,

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:48.060
and we haven’t been able
to resolve it.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:54.700
Is it possible – one is asking
this question most seriously –

00:54:54.710 --> 00:55:02.590
is this at all possible to be
totally completely free of fear,

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.110
not only physical forms of fear

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:12.410
but much more subtle forms
of fear inwardly.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:20.810
Conscious fears and
the deep undiscovered fears,

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:26.780
fears that are deeply
in our consciousness

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:33.080
which we have never even
examined that they are there.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:42.260
Examination does not mean analysis.
I know it is the fashion

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:47.890
that if you have any problem
turn to the analyst.

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:53.370
I hope there aren’t any here!

00:55:53.380 --> 00:56:02.750
And the analyst is like you and me,
only he has got a certain technique.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:11.750
But we must examine
what is observation and analysis.

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:17.100
Analysis implies
there is an analyser.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:23.780
Is the analyser different
from that which he analyses?

00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:28.670
Or the analyser
is the analysed?

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:33.530
You understand the question?

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.670
The analyser is the analysed.
That is an obvious fact.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:52.720
I am analysing myself
but who is the analyser, in me,

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:55.070
 who says, ‘I must analyse’?

00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:01.030
It is still the analyser
separating himself from the analysed,

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:07.230
and then examining that which
is going to be analysed - right?

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:15.430
So, the analyser is that which
he is examining, analysing.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:21.380
Both are the same,
it is a trick played by thought.

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:28.090
So, when we observe,
there is no analysis,

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:33.440
merely to observe things
as they are.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:40.310
To observe actually what is,
not to analyse what is,

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:45.660
because in the process of analysis
one can deceive oneself.

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:48.750
And if you like to play
that game

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:55.060
you can go on endlessly
until you die analysing,

00:57:55.070 --> 00:58:03.690
and never bringing about a
radical transformation within oneself.

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:12.780
Whereas observation, to look,
to look at the present world as it is,

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:16.520
not as a Dutchman, Englishman,
or French or this or that,

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:22.680
but to see actually
what is happening.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:33.760
That is observation, pure observation
of things as they are.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:43.350
So we have to examine
or observe what fear is,

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.650
not what is the cause of fear
– we will look at that presently –

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:52.540
not what is the cause of fear
which implies analysis,

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.880
going further, further back,
the origin of fear,

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.930
– we’ll find that out
in a minute –

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:09.760
but to learn the art of observing,
not translating what you observe,

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:14.260
or interpreting what you observe
but just to observe,

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:18.740
as you would observe
a lovely flower.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:22.380
The moment you tear it to pieces
the flower is not.

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:25.020
That is what analysis is.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:29.590
But to observe
the beauty of a flower,

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:35.850
the light in a cloud,
the evening light,

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:41.780
a tree by itself in a forest,
just to observe it.

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:49.760
So similarly if we can,
to observe fear.

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:56.490
What is the root of fear,
not the various aspects of fear?

00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.290
Right? Can we go on with this?

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.440
That is,
suppose I am afraid.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:10.670
Suppose – I am not –
suppose I am afraid,

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:16.850
I must make this point
very clear.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.720
What the speaker says,
he lives,

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:26.640
otherwise he wouldn’t get up on
a platform and talk about it.

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:33.360
He has done it for sixty years,
he wouldn’t deceive himself,

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:38.770
one can, but he has
gone into it very deeply.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.790
So what he says
is what to him is a fact,

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.160
not just an illusion,
an escape.

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:55.680
So we are asking if it is at all
possible to be free of fear,

01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:58.750
absolutely.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:05.040
Psychologically, inwardly,
what is the root of fear?

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:09.760
What does fear mean?

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:21.420
Fear of something
that has given you pain,

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:25.570
fear of what might happen.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:35.420
That is the past, or what might happen
in the future - right?

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:42.980
Not what might happen now
because now there is no fear.

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:52.530
But you can see for yourself
fear is a time process - right?

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.460
Fear of something
that has happened last week,

01:01:56.470 --> 01:02:04.330
an incident which has brought
psychological pain, or physical pain,

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:10.770
and the fear that it might happen
again tomorrow:

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:16.780
losing a job, not achieving
something you want,

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:25.680
not achieving illumination
and all that stuff.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:37.500
So fear is a movement
in time - right?

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:41.960
A movement from the past
through the present,

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:45.080
modifying itself to the future.

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:56.490
So the origin of fear
is thought.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:02.350
And thought is time,

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:11.930
because thought is the accumulation
of knowledge through experience,

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:17.310
memory, response of memory,
thought, action.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:31.540
So thought-time are one,
and thought-time is the root of fear.

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.500
That is fairly obvious.
It is so.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:41.090
Now, it is not a question of
stopping thought or time.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.500
Of course it would be
impossible to stop it

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:51.180
because who is the entity
that says, ‘I must stop thought’?

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:57.280
Which would be absurd because
 that entity is part of thought.

01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:00.820
Are you following all this?

01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:07.660
So this idea of stopping thought
is impossible.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:12.330
That implies a controller
who is trying to control thought.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:18.170
The controller
is created by thought.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:25.850
So please just listen to this,
just observe.

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:30.000
The observation
is an action in itself,

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:33.680
not that one must do something
about fear.

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.980
I wonder
if you understand this?

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:43.570
Look: suppose I am afraid
about something or other,

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:49.700
darkness, my wife running away,
or I am lonely, or this or that.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:52.250
I am frightened, deeply.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.310
You come along and tell me,

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.850
you explain to me
the whole movement of fear,

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:07.220
the origin of fear,
which is time.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:13.320
I had pain, or I went
through some accident,

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:21.260
incident that has caused fear,
recorded it in the brain,

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:28.710
and that memory of that
past incident might happen again,

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.530
and therefore there is fear.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:35.120
So you have explained this
to me.

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:39.360
And I listen very carefully
to your explanation,

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:43.600
I see the logic of it,
the sanity of it,

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:47.760
I don’t reject it, I listen.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:54.790
And that means listening
becomes an art.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:00.930
I don’t reject what you are saying,
nor accept, but observe.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:08.370
So I observe that what you tell me
about time, thought, is actual.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.800
I don’t say, ‘I must stop
time and thought’,

01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:15.970
but you have explained to me,
don’t do that,

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:26.330
but just observe how fear arises,
it is a movement of thought, time.

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:34.160
Just observe this movement
and don’t move away from it,

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:38.600
don’t escape from it,
live with it, look at it,

01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:45.030
put your energy
in your looking.

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:53.090
Then you will see
that fear begins to dissolve

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.070
because you have done
nothing about it,

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.390
you have just observed,
you have given your attention to it.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:06.710
That very attention is like
bringing light on fear.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.230
Attention means giving all
your energy in that observation.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:16.340
Is this clear somewhat?

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.720
Sir, unfortunately
we have only two talks,

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:29.180
I wish
there were more talks.

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:34.460
If you begin to ask questions
we will become something different.

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:39.680
But I hope you don’t mind
if I go on.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:44.790
May I?

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.910
So, observation without analysis
implies

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:04.070
giving your total attention
to a problem.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:12.630
The problem which is relationship,
the problem which is fear,

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:18.870
and also we have to go into
the problem of pleasure.

01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:26.710
May I ask
what time it is?

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:33.000
Beg your pardon?

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:36.300
Quarter past twelve.

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:40.640
We have talked
for an hour.

01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:44.990
Do you want to continue
another half an hour?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.780
Can you bear it?

01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:55.050
It’s up to you,
not to me, sirs.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:05.240
Also – sir, would you mind
not taking photographs.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:14.920
Please,
this is very serious all this.

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:21.380
This is not something you play with
for a day and drop it.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:29.780
It concerns our lives,
our whole existence.

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:40.480
And if you are at all serious we
must give our attention to all this.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:49.820
Why is it that man
has pursued pleasure?

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:56.810
Please ask yourself why.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:03.910
Is pleasure opposite to pain?

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.410
Please go into it a little bit.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:10.040
We have all had pain
of different kinds,

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:15.340
both physical and psychological.

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:23.290
Psychologically most of us from
childhood have been wounded, hurt,

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.480
that is pain.

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:33.890
And the consequence of that pain
has been to withdraw,

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:40.300
isolate oneself,
not to be further hurt.

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:44.930
We are hurt from childhood,
through school,

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:50.890
by comparing ourselves with
somebody else who is more clever.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:56.230
We have hurt ourselves
and others have hurt us

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:04.120
through various forms
of scoldings, hurting,

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:11.460
saying something brutal,
terrorising us.

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:16.870
And there is this deep hurt
with all its consequences,

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:24.050
which is isolation, resistance,
more and more withdrawing.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:29.570
And the opposite of that
we think is pleasure.

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:35.430
Pain and the opposite of it
is pleasure.

01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:37.780
Is that so?

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.040
So we have to examine closely
if you have the energy,

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.180
if you have the time,
if you want to,

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:56.220
is goodness opposite of
that which is not good?

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:01.710
If goodness
is the opposite,

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:09.020
then that goodness contains
its own opposite - right?

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.430
Therefore it is not good.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:22.670
Goodness is something totally
separate from that which it is not.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:30.870
So, is pleasure – please just listen
to this if you don’t mind,

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:33.870
one is asking this
most respectfully –

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:42.500
is pleasure something
opposite of pain?

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:52.430
Or it is a contrast and we are
always pursuing the contrast,

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:56.520
the opposite.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:02.870
So one is asking,
is pleasure separate entirely,

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:11.760
like goodness – which is not
pleasurable? You understand?

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:21.070
Or is pleasure
tainted by pain?

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:35.730
So when you look closely at pleasure
it is always remembrance, isn’t it?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.080
One never says
when one is happy,

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.280
‘How happy I am’,
it is always after,

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.600
the remembrance of that thing
which gave you pleasure,

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.890
and the remembrance
of that pleasure.

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:57.170
Like a sunset, when you look
at the glory of the evening,

01:13:57.170 --> 01:14:01.090
full of that extraordinary light,

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:05.180
there is great pleasure,
great delight.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:14.830
Then that is remembered,
then pleasure is born.

01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:24.360
So, pleasure is part of thought too.
It is so obvious.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.020
So the next problem is

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:30.720
– it is very complex,
like all human problems –

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:39.300
is it possible
to end all sorrow?

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:46.980
Because where there is sorrow
there is no love.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.410
Where there is sorrow obviously
there cannot be intelligence.

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.820
We will go into that word,
which is a very complex word,

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.680
intelligence.

01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:18.490
You know,
the understanding of relationship,

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:28.320
fear, pleasure and sorrow,
is to bring order in our house.

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:39.040
Without order
you cannot possibly meditate.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.330
You understand that word?

01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:44.780
Unfortunately that word
has been brought to the West

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:50.350
by the Eastern people.

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:54.880
Now, the speaker puts meditation
at the end of the talks

01:15:54.890 --> 01:16:01.360
because there is no possibility
of right meditation

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:09.710
if you have not put your house,
psychological house, in order.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.370
If the house is in disorder,
psychological house, what you are,

01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:22.860
if that house is not in order
what is the point of meditating?

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:30.540
It is just an escape.
It leads to all kinds of illusions.

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.860
And you may sit cross legged

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:37.720
or stand on your head
for the rest of your life

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.540
but that is not meditation.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:51.710
Meditation must begin with bringing
about complete order in your house:

01:16:51.710 --> 01:17:05.490
that is, order in your relationship,
order in one’s desires,

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:11.980
pleasure and so on.

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:25.980
And also, one of our causes of
disorder in our life is sorrow.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:38.090
This is a common factor,
common reality in all human beings.

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:45.330
Everyone goes through
this tragedy of sorrow,

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:50.270
here or in the Asiatic world
or in the Western world.

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:56.890
Again this is a common thing
we all share.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:04.250
There is not only so-called
personal sorrow

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:09.650
but there is
the sorrow of mankind,

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:17.490
sorrow which wars
have brought about,

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:23.820
five thousand years
of historical record,

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:33.880
every year there has been a war,
killing each other,

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:42.450
violence, terror, brutality, maiming
people, people have no hands, eyes,

01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:46.840
all the horrors
and the brutality of war,

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:56.240
which has brought
incalculable misery to mankind.

01:18:56.770 --> 01:19:05.520
It is not only one’s own sorrow
but the sorrow of mankind,

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:09.840
the sorrow when you see a man
who has nothing whatsoever,

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.710
just a piece of cloth

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:18.740
and for the rest of one’s life
he is going to be that way.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:25.180
Not in these Western countries
but in the Asiatic world it is like that.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:30.220
And when you see that person
there is sorrow.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:36.220
There is also sorrow
when people are caught in illusion;

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:48.700
like going from one guru to another,
which is escaping from yourself.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.720
That is a sorrow,
to observe this.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.900
The clever people going
off to the East.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.970
Writing books about it,
praising some guru,

01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:02.410
and we all fall for
that nonsense.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:07.320
That is also sorrow.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.740
Sorrow that comes when you see

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:14.490
what the politicians
are doing in the world.

01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:23.950
Thinking in terms of tribalism,
that is also sorrow.

01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:39.210
So there is personal sorrow and
the vast cloud of sorrow of mankind.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:48.910
Sorrow is not something
romantic, sentimental,

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:53.480
illogical,
it is there.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:01.890
My son dies and
it has shattered one’s life.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:11.170
And we have lived with this sorrow
from time measureless.

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:18.170
And apparently one has not resolved
this problem.

01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:26.780
When one suffers
one seeks consolation,

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:33.150
which is an escape
from the fact of sorrow.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:46.650
When there is that grief,
you try every form of amusement,

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:53.710
escape,
but it is always there.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:07.460
And apparently humanity
has not resolved it.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:10.150
And we are asking
the question

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:17.780
whether it is possible
to be free of it completely?

01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:26.740
Not avoiding it,
not seeking consolation,

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:40.210
not escaping into some
fanciful theory, but to live with it.

01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:45.340
Just let’s understand what we mean
by that word to ‘live with it’:

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:54.350
not to let it become a habit
like most people do;

01:22:54.870 --> 01:23:01.860
they live with nationalities,
which is most destructive,

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:08.600
they live with their own
separate religious conclusions,

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:16.080
they live with their own
fanciful ideas and ideals,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.250
and that again brings
their own conflict.

01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:27.530
So to live with something,
to live with sorrow,

01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:35.590
not accept it,
not become habituated to it,

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:42.020
that is, to look at it,
to observe it without any escape,

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.560
without any question of
trying to go beyond it,

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:52.890
just to hold it
in your hand and look.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:10.700
Which is, sorrow is also part of
this tremendous sense of loneliness,

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:13.560
you may have many friends,
you may be married,

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.340
you may have
all kinds of things,

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:23.670
but inwardly there is this feeling
of complete loneliness.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:31.820
And that is part of sorrow.

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:40.940
To observe that loneliness
without any direction,

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:42.790
without trying to go beyond it,

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:47.610
without trying to find
a substitute for it,

01:24:47.610 --> 01:25:01.140
to live with it, not worship it,
not become psychotic about it.

01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:08.060
Which means to give
all your attention to that pain,

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:13.170
to that grief, to that sorrow.

01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:24.780
So when my son dies, or somebody
whom I think I love, dies,

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:33.600
there is great grief, and without
running away from it, just to...

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:44.800
It is a great thing to understand
suffering because then

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:52.760
where there is freedom from sorrow,
there is compassion.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:26:01.880
And one is not compassionate as long
as you are anchored to any belief,

01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:08.080
to your particular form
of religious symbol.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:15.570
Compassion is
freedom from sorrow.

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:18.340
And where there is compassion
there is love,

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:24.370
and with that compassion
goes intelligence –

01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:31.480
not the intelligence of thought
with its cunning,

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.130
with its adjustments,

01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:39.790
with its capacity to put up
with anything.

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:44.560
Compassion means
the ending of sorrow

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.790
and only then
is there intelligence.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:27:00.930
We will continue tomorrow if you
don’t mind, talking about death,

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.430
what happens, if anything
happens after death,

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:10.860
and what is
the significance of death,

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:16.860
and what is meditation.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:24.130
That is if you can
bear it until tomorrow.

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:32.890
May I most respectfully
request that you don’t clap.

01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:37.900
By clapping
you are not encouraging me.

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:44.570
You are clapping because
you understand it for yourself.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:28:01.140
